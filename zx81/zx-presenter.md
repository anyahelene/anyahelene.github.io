# Using the ZX81 for Conference Presentations

The organizers of the wonderful [NOOL 2017 workshop](https://2017.splashcon.org/track/nool-2017) ("The -2th Workshop on New Object-Oriented Languages (NOOL) 2017") had the incredible foresight (or, perhaps, hindsight...) to publish a [ZX81 Call for Papers](http://dynamicaspects.org/nool17-cfp.pdf), which immediately made me think that:

* a) I need to write a paper for this workshop, and
* b) I'll definitely have to do the presentation on my ZX81.

Point a) resulted in the design (and, hopefully, eventual implementation) of the Algool programming language, since I obviously didn't already have a new object oriented language to write about. (Turns out nobody else did either, but I didn't really know that in advance.)

And point b) resulted in me finally spending some time with the ZX81 I'd bought off Ebay a few years ago, and create the software I needed for the presentation + hacking it to run off a USB powerbank. *(It may also have resulted in me being asked to organize the workshop next year.)*
