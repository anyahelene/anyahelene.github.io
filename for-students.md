# Information for students

## Bachelor students doing projects

* You're expected to follow standard rules on research ethics, plagiarism and co-authorship – see [Research and publication ethics](#research-and-publication-ethics), below. You should be particularly careful with citations, use of sources and plagiarism. Co-authorship questions will most likely not apply to you unless you're collaborating with someone or your results are publishable.

## Master and PhD students

* You're expected to follow standard rules on research ethics, plagiarism and co-authorship – see [Research and publication ethics](#research-and-publication-ethics), below. For PhD students, this is covered by the compulsory course on [Theory of Science and Ethics (MNF990)](http://www.uib.no/en/course/MNF990).


## Research and publication ethics

### General
* [Guidelines for research ethics in science and technology](https://www.etikkom.no/en/ethical-guidelines-for-research/guidelines-for-research-ethics-in-science-and-technology/summary/) (from [The Norwegian National Committees for Research Ethics](https://www.etikkom.no/en/))
* [ACM Code of Ethics](http://www.acm.org/about-acm/code-of-ethics)

### Plagiarism
Plagiarism is passing off someone's results, ideas, thinking or words as your own, for example by not referring to / citing previous work, not marking quoted text explicitly or by reusing text, source code, tables or graphics (reuse without permission could in some cases also be a violation of copyright law). You can also *self-plagiarise* if the “someone” is yourself (e.g., passing off your own work as new work – you should always cite/quote your own previous work properly).

* UiB has nice [guidelines for the use of sources in student work](http://www.uib.no/en/education/49058/use-sources-written-work) (also in [Norwegian](http://www.uib.no/student/49084/l%C3%A6r-deg-%C3%A5-bruke-kilder-riktig))
* The Univeristy Library has a nice [movie about plagiarism](http://www.uib.no/en/quality-in-studies/78186/movie-about-plagiarism-university-library)
* At the UiB, plagiarism is treated as [cheating](http://www.uib.no/en/quality-in-studies/77940/cheating-and-its-consequences), and may result in annulment of exams and/or expulsion from all higher education in Norway for up to one year.

### Authorship
In general, UiB expects co-authors to fulfil the [Vancouver criteria](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) for co-authorship:

* Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
* Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND
* Final approval of the version to be published; AND
* Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
