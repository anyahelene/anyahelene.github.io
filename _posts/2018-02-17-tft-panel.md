## Tiny TFT panels

I needed a small display for a little project (showing some animations
in my office window), and none of the electronics stores nearby had
anything suitable, so I ended up digging out an (as yet unused) LCD
module I bought off Ebay a few years ago.

![TFT01-2.8 display]({{ "/assets/img/tft/20180217_185448.jpg" | absolute_url }})
 
It's a cheap non-branded panel from China (I paid USD 10.95 back in
2014), the only markings being “2.8 inch TFT 240x320” and “V1.1”. The
listing said “2.8 inch 1.8" TFT LCD module Display ILI9325 with touch
panel SD card 240x320” (the actual panel is 2.8", not 1.8"), and no
documentation was provided. You can still find a bunch of them on Ebay
for roughly the same price.

I knew I'd gotten my other cheap panel (a 2.4" panel, also using the
ILI9325 chip) working with a Raspberry Pi back in the day, but I don't
think I've tried this one before, so some exploration was needed to
find the right connections and drivers and so on.

This panel has a 40-pin connector which you'll find on a lot of tiny
LCDs (there's also ready made Chinese shields for interfacing with
Arduino and so on). Initial investigations led me to
[ElectroDragon](http://www.electrodragon.com/w/TFT_LCD), whose pages
describe panels that are almost exactly like mine (except they don't
have a 2.8" panel). But the pins and voltages seem correct: RS
(data/command), WR (write), CS (chip select), REST (reset) and the
data pins (DB00–DB15) need to be connected to the GPIO pins on the
Raspberry Pi.

The ElectroDragon page also has this useful info *“Module the user
through the back of the PCB J3 pad set 8/16 bit interface, shorting J3
pad module in 16-bit mode, not less then work in 8-bit mode, module
shipments default OPEN, which is shipped”*. My panel has an *open* J3
on the back, which makes me think it's supposed to work in 8 bit
mode. It also says that *“The default is 8-bit interface, 8-bit mode,
only 8 (DB8-DB15, DB0-DB7 ground or to unsettled to connect).”* which
*might* mean that the 8-bit bus should be connected to DB8–DB15 rather
than to DB00–DB07 (as you might expect).

Anyway, it turns out there's a nice Linux framebuffer driver for small
LCDs: [fbtft](https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki). The closest panel
on the [supported device
list](https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/LCD-Modules) is `itdb28`,
for which the default pin wiring seems to be
*gpios=reset:17,dc:1,wr:0,cs:21,db00:9,db01:11,db02:18,db03:23,db04:24,db05:25,db06:8,db07:7*. It's
been a long time since last time I did Raspberry Pi stuff (Pis back
then had 26 pins rather than 40), but fortunately there are now [nice
online overviews of the Pi GPIO pins](https://pinout.xyz/). I'm still
a bit uncertain about why the GPIO pins from the BroadCom chip seem to
be somewhat arbitrarily connected to the Pi pins (probably something
to do with PCB layout or something). Anyway, with all the ground pins
scattered around, there's no chance of wiring up the data bus with a
single 8-pin cable, rather than individual wires.

So, I wire up the panel, boot up the Pi, and try the suggested driver:

```
modprobe fbtft_device name=itdb28 gpios=reset:17,dc:1,wr:0,cs:21,db00:9,db01:11,db02:18,db03:23,db04:24,db05:25,db06:8,db07:7,led:4
```

This is supposed to initialize the panel and set up a framebuffer
device (in `/dev/fb1` – `/dev/fb0` is connected to the built-in HDMI
output). I got some handy tips from [this
blog](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=157618),
including the suggestion to test the panel with [this
giraffe](https://github.com/marekburiak/ILI9341_due/blob/master/examples/sdFatTftBitmap/images/giraffe.565).

```
tail --bytes 153600 giraffe.565 > /dev/fb1
```

Anyway, neither the driver loading nor the giraffe had any effect
(apart from the backlight turning on when I connect `LED_A` to 3.3V). So,
I tried:

* Connecting db00–db07 on the driver side to DB08–DB15 (as suggested
  by ElectroDragon), and to DB00–DB07 (which is what I'd think by
  default). (In order to try the driver with different options, it
  should be unloaded first using `sudo rmmod fb_ili9325; sudo rmmod fbtft_device`.)
* Double-checking the connections, and using different pins on the
  Raspberry Pi.
* Following the directions for
  [ITDB02-2.8](https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/LCD-Modules#itdb02-28)
  more closely, including reading the datasheets and such – and using
  5V VCC (which turns out to *not* be right, so don't try that!
  fortunately, no damage done).
* Connecting all 16 data pins, and listing them on the `modprobe`
  command line.
* Getting *really* annoyed that most of the panel docs I could find
  never mentioned any specifics on the meaning of the jumpers on the
  back of the card.
* *Seriously* considering programming the GPIO pins directly just to
  see if I could get the panel to respond.

## The “TFT01-2.8”
Finally, I went through all the similar-looking panels on Ebay, and
finally found out that it's most likely set to a 16-bit bus by default
(rather than the 8 bits that seem more common), and it's probably a
“[TFT01-2.8](http://www.elecfreaks.com/wiki/index.php?title=2.8%22_TFT_LCD:_TFT01-2.8)”
panel (docs still don't say anything sensible about the jumpers and
whether they may or may not be set to 16-bit mode).

Armed with this knowledge, I studied the
[fbtft_device](https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/fbtft_device) docs
again an finally found the `buswidth` option. Yay! My panel is
probably *not* covered by the standard drivers, and should be set up
with the `custom` option:

```
sudo modprobe fbtft_device custom name=fb_ili9325 buswidth=16 ...
```

*This* had an effect! The panel turned a flickering greyish instead of
 white. Unfortunately, even trying different variations of options
 didn't really help getting the panel past the flickering stage. One
 of the Ebay entires directed me to the `CTE28` driver for the
 [UTFT](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=51) library
 – so I also tried the initialization command sequence they used.

Getting ready to give up, I though I'd try one more thing: rewire it
all to use “sensible” pins on the Raspberry Pi (i.e., keep related
stuff close together, so the wiring is less messy). This probably
doesn't really matter, but it turned out to make a difference: the
panel was *finally* initialized correctly, and I could even see
something when I tried the giraffe picture. Probably, I had messed up
some of the pins at some point... Giraffe was still a bit mangled, but
that was fixed by rotating the display. The final, *working*
configuration turned out to be:

```
sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=fb_ili9325 custom rotate=90 bgr=1 \
   buswidth=16 width=240 height=320 \
   gpios=reset:17,dc:2,wr:3,cs:27,db00:21,db01:20,db02:16,db03:12,db04:1,db05:7,db06:8,db07:25,db08:26,db09:19,db10:13,db11:6,db12:5,db13:0,db14:11,db15:9 \

```

Without the custom `init` the colors are a bit off (lighter than
expected) – probably this should be adjusted by the `gamma` option,
rather than overriding `init`.

## A working setup

The pin connections I'm using are:

```
 TFT   GPIO  (RPi)
--------------------------------------
 GND     –   ( 6)   # GND
 VCC     –   ( 1)   # 3.3V
 LED_A   –   (17)   # 3.3V
 REST   17   (11)   # Reset
 RS      2   ( 3)   # Data/Command (DC)
 WR      3   ( 5)   # Write
 CS     27   (13)   # Chip select
 DB00   21   (40)   # 16-bit bus

 DB04    1   (28)
 DB05    7   (26)
 DB06    8   (24)
 DB07   25   (22)
 DB08   26   (37)
 DB09   19   (35)

 DB13    0   (27)
 DB14   11   (23)
 DB15    9   (21)
```

In order to have the panel start automatically on boot, put the driver
options in a new file `/etc/modprobe.d/fbtft.conf`:

```
options fbtft_device rotate=90 fps=20 custom bgr=1 buswidth=16 width=240 height=320 name=fb_ili9325 gpios=reset:17,dc:2,wr:3,cs:27,db00:21,db01:20,db02:16,db03:12,db04:1,db05:7,db06:8,db07:25,db08:26,db09:19,db10:13,db11:6,db12:5,db13:0,db14:11,db15:9 init=-1,0xE5,0x78F0,-1,0x01,0x0100,-1,0x02,0x0200,-1,0x03,0x1030,-1,0x04,0x0000,-1,0x08,0x0207,-1,0x09,0x0000,-1,0x0A,0x0000,-1,0x0C,0x0000,-1,0x0D,0x0000,-1,0x0F,0x0000,-1,0x10,0x0000,-1,0x11,0x0007,-1,0x12,0x0000,-1,0x13,0x0000,-1,0x07,0x0001,-2,200,-1,0x10,0x1690,-1,0x11,0x0227,-2,50,-1,0x12,0x000D,-2,50,-1,0x13,0x1200,-1,0x29,0x000A,-1,0x2B,0x000C,-2,50,-1,0x20,0x0000,-1,0x21,0x0000,-1,0x30,0x0000,-1,0x31,0x0404,-1,0x32,0x0003,-1,0x35,0x0405,-1,0x36,0x0808,-1,0x37,0x0407,-1,0x38,0x0303,-1,0x39,0x0707,-1,0x3C,0x0504,-1,0x3D,0x0808,-1,0x50,0x0000,-1,0x51,0x00EF,-1,0x52,0x0000,-1,0x53,0x013F,-1,0x60,0xA700,-1,0x61,0x0001,-1,0x6A,0x0000,-1,0x80,0x0000,-1,0x81,0x0000,-1,0x82,0x0000,-1,0x83,0x0000,-1,0x84,0x0000,-1,0x85,0x0000,-1,0x90,0x0010,-1,0x92,0x0000,-1,0x07,0x0133,-3
```

and add `fbtft_device` to `/etc/modules`.

## X11 Setup

To make it work with X11, tell the X server to use `/dev/fb1`. My
Raspberry Pi setup already had a framebuffer configuration in
`/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbturbo.conf`. I copied it to
`/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/98-fbturbo-tft.conf` and modified it to look
like this:

```
Section "Device"
        Identifier      "TFT01-2.8 ILI9325 LCD"
        Driver          "fbturbo"
        Option          "fbdev" "/dev/fb1"

        #Option          "SwapbuffersWait" "true"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"TFT01-2.8 240x320 LCD"
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth	16
		Weight	5 6 5
	EndSubSection
EndSection

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"TFT01-2.8"
	Screen		"TFT01-2.8 240x320 LCD"
EndSection
```

Also, in order to make it possible to run `startx` via SSH, I modified
`/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config` to say `allowed_users=anybody`.

As long as it's named `98-fbturbo-tft.conf` the TFT will be used by
default rather than the HDMI output specified in
`99-fbturbo.conf` (the lowest number is the default). Alternatively, it can be specified explicitly via
the `-layout` option: `startx -- -layout TFT01-2.8`.

If you add a `ServerLayout` and `Screen` section to `99-fbturbo.conf`,
you can also start X on the HDMI output. Mine looks like this:

```
Section "Device"
        Identifier      "FB"
        Driver          "fbturbo"
        Option          "fbdev" "/dev/fb0"

        Option          "SwapbuffersWait" "true"
EndSection
Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"FB-HDMI"
	Device "FB"
EndSection

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"HDMI"
	Screen		"FB-HDMI"
EndSection
```

(You could even run a single desktop across both displays at once, by
listing multiple screens in `ServerLayout`.)

For now, my Pi doesn't automatically boot into desktop mode on the LCD
panel – but if I'm going to use it to display cool stuff, I should of
course set it up to start X11 at boot time, and run whatever code I
want (duckpond with jumping frogs, for example...)

## Other things

### Booting with the console on the TFT display

This is [apparently also
possible](https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/Boot-console), but I
haven't tried it yet.

### Touch input

Haven't tried this either, yet. Touch functionality seems to use 5
pins, so it should still fit on the 40-pin modern Pis – we're
currently using 16 pins for data and 4 for control, out of 28 GPIO
pins (the other 12 Pi pins are ground and power).
