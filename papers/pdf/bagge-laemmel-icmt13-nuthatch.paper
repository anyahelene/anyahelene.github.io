Abstract:
  Software transformations in the Nuthatch style are described as walks over trees (possibly graphs) that proceed in programmer- defined steps which may observe join points of the walk, may observe and affect state associated with the walk, may rewrite the walked tree, may contribute to a built tree, and must walk somewhere, typically along one branch or another. The approach blends well with OO programming. We have implemented the approach in the Nuthatch/J library for Java.
