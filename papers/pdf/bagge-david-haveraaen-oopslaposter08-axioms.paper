Abstract:
  <em>Unit testing</em> is a popular way of increasing software reliability. <em>Axioms</em>, known from program specification, allow functionality to be described as rules or equations. We show a method and prototype tool for using the proposed <code>concept</code> and <code>axiom</code> features of the upcoming C++0x standard for automated unit testing.
